# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Part of the Odin Project [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/). Uses Javascript (and JQuery), HTML, and CSS to create an online version of the hand game commonly known as Rock, Paper, Scissors. In this game, you play against a computer opponent. Since only three choices of hand gesture leads to many ties, I've increased the number of gestures (or "weapons") to five. The implementation is the common variant "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock".
